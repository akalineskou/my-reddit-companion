## Features

### Info bar

Browsing to pages from reddit opens an information bar at the top of the page.  
The bar shows the current score and title of the page submission on reddit and  
makes it easy to vote, save the post, and view comments.

## History
An almost complete rewrite (bar html and css are left pretty much intact).
